Key constraint: **only one mutable reference** at a time (no aliasing).\n\n```rust\nlet mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet r1 = &mut v;  // mutable borrow\nr1.push(4);\n// let r2 = &mut v;  // ERROR: can't have 2 mutable borrows\n\nlet r3 = &v;  // OK: immutable borrow after mutable is done\n```\n\nThis prevents concurrent modification bugs. Use `&mut` when a function needs to modify its input; otherwise prefer immutable references.",
