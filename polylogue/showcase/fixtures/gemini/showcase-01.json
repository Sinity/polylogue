They learn through a process called backpropagation: 1) Input flows forward through layers of neurons. 2) Each neuron applies a weighted sum followed by an activation function. 3) The output is compared to the target, creating an error. 4) This error is propagated backward, adjusting weights to minimize the error. This iterative process, repeated over many examples, allows the network to learn patterns.",

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data: the network discovers hidden patterns or structures (like clustering similar customers). Supervised learning requires more labeled data but typically achieves higher accuracy on specific tasks. Unsupervised learning is useful for exploratory analysis when labels aren't available.",
