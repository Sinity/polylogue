Why your current script fails
The exception comes from this line in `get_drive_service`:
creds = flow.run_console()

In recent google-auth-oauthlib versions, `InstalledAppFlow` no longer exposes `run_console()`. The supported methods are:
- `run_local_server(port=0, authorization_prompt_message=..., open_browser=True, ...)`
- `run_flow(...)` (internal helper, not for direct use)
- Older tutorials used `run_console()`, but it was removed.

Fix: replace the console-based flow with the local webserver flow. Example:

flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(str(credentials_path), SCOPES)
# Use the loopback local server flow (recommended)
creds = flow.run_local_server(
    port=0,             # pick any free port
    open_browser=True,  # will open your browser
    authorization_prompt_message="Please authorize in your browser, then return.",
    success_message="Authentication flow completed. You may close this window.",
)

If you absolutely need a pure-CLI, non-browser flow, you’d have to switch to the OAuth device flow (not provided directly by google-auth-oauthlib’s InstalledAppFlow), or use the legacy googleapiclient sample helper. Easiest and secure path is the loopback local server.

Two more notes:
- Your `credentials.json` is fine for an Installed App (loopback redirect, http://localhost).
- Keep `token.json` alongside your script; after the first sign-in the refresh flow won’t require re-auth.

Now, the “most elegant way” to process everything without manual inputs
Goal: replicate what your converter does, but across your entire Google Drive “Google AI Studio” exports, automatically pairing attachments with the conversation logs, with no manual input.

You have two feasible approaches:

A) Drive API centric, end-to-end discovery
- Discover conversations (JSON/JSONL) via Drive API queries, parse them, and auto-download any referenced attachments using their `id`s.
- Pros: Guaranteed ID matching for attachments; you do not rely on any filename conventions.
- Cons: Requires OAuth and may re-download items you already have mounted.

B) Local mount centric (use your /mnt/gdrive/Google AI Studio)
- Walk the mounted directory tree, discover the conversation JSON/JSONL files, and map attachment IDs to local files.
- Pros: No network round-trips or OAuth complexity during bulk conversion; faster, resume-friendly.
- Cons: Must correctly map Drive file IDs to local files. If the mount does not preserve Drive IDs in filenames or extended attributes, you can’t reliably match “14SoVVi8k…” to “somefile.txt” without an index.

Given your listing, most attachments are named as hex-like hashes (e.g., `1169185eda4b...mp3`), and the chat logs carry attachment `id`s like `14SoVVi8keIdNUcLkc6WB9ynHB2jOjwoD`. There’s no clear filename encoding of Drive IDs. Therefore, you can’t reliably match via mount alone.

Recommendation: hybrid approach with a local cache/index
1) Build a local ID->path index using the Drive API once:
   - List files in your target Drive folder(s) with fields `id, name, mimeType, md5Checksum, size, parents`.
   - Persist a `drive_index.sqlite` or `drive_index.jsonl` mapping `id -> {name, mimeType, size, md5, parentPath}`.
   - For any file not present locally (by `id`), download it into a structured cache:
     - `cache_root/<id>/original_name` and a small `meta.json` with `id`, `name`, `mimeType`, `md5`, `size`.
   - If your mount already has a file with exactly that `id` or a prior cache hit, skip download.

2) When converting a chat log:
   - For each chunk with `driveDocument.id` or `driveImage.id`, resolve via the ID->path index:
     - If a cached file exists: embed/link to the cached path.
     - Else fall back to Drive URL.
   - This guarantees correct conversation-to-attachment pairing regardless of filename differences.

3) Advantages of this hybrid:
   - Correctness: Attachment IDs always resolve.
   - Efficiency: After first run, everything is local. Re-runs are fast and offline.
   - No manual inputs: You point the tool to your Drive folder ID or let it crawl a known parent; it does the rest.

Concrete plan and minimal changes

Part 1: Authentication fix in your script
- Replace `run_console()` with `run_local_server()` as shown above.

Part 2: Add a one-time indexer
Add a new module `drive_indexer.py` that:
- Walks one or more parent folders on Drive (e.g., the folder that corresponds to “Google AI Studio” in your Drive).
- Uses the Files `list` endpoint, with `q` filtering by parent and `trashed = false`, and `fields=files(id, name, mimeType, md5Checksum, size, parents), nextPageToken`.
- Writes `drive_index.sqlite` with tables:
  - `files(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, mimeType TEXT, size INTEGER, md5 TEXT, parentId TEXT, parentPath TEXT, localPath TEXT, cachedAt TIMESTAMP)`
- Optional: if a file not in cache, download it to `cache_root/<id>/original_name`; update `localPath`.

Part 3: Make the converter use the index
Modify `convert_gemini_chatlog.py`:
- Add arg `--drive-index` path and `--cache-root`.
- At startup: load a small in-memory map of `id -> localPath` from `drive_index.sqlite` (or lazy-lookup).
- In `format_user_drive_doc` and `format_user_drive_image`, prefer the indexed local path or cached file path. Only call `download_file()` if:
  - No cached path exists AND user permitted downloads this run.

This gives you immediate correct embedding/linking and avoids API calls during mass conversion if the cache is warm.

Part 4: Discover and convert everything automatically
New driver script `bulk_convert.py`:
- Options:
  - `--drive-parent-id=<FOLDER_ID>`: crawl under this folder via API to discover candidate chat logs (.json, .jsonl, maybe `.jsonl.txt` you showed).
  - Or `--local-root=/mnt/gdrive/Google AI Studio`: fall back to local discovery.
- Pipeline:
  1) Ensure Drive index exists/up-to-date:
     - If API mode: run `drive_indexer.update()` first, refreshing new files and downloading missing ones to cache.
  2) Find candidate chat logs:
     - API mode: `mimetype='application/json' or text/plain with name ending in .json(.txt) or .jsonl(.txt)'` heuristics; or scan by name patterns you actually use.
     - Local mode: `glob` in `/mnt/gdrive/Google AI Studio` for `*.json`, `*.jsonl`, `*.jsonl.txt`.
  3) For each, call your converter with:
     - `--no-download` (preferred, because attachments resolved from cache/index)
     - `--download-dir` disabled
     - `--drive-index` and `--cache-root`
     - `--output-dir` to a structured output tree, e.g., `output/<relative_path>.md`
- Parallelize conversion with a small worker pool if needed.

Attachment matching correctness
- By keying off Drive `id`, you are immune to renames, duplicates, and the varied naming you showed in the mount.
- Your previous concern (“whether, if you go through the mount, you can match the attachments properly to their conversation logs”) is valid: the mount filenames do not encode the Drive ID, and the chat log’s references are by ID. The hybrid index solves this cleanly.

Small improvements to your current converter
- File-name sanitization: keep your existing `sanitize_filename`, but also prefer `id` for guaranteed uniqueness in cache paths: `cache_root/<id>/<safe_original_name>`.
- Update the YAML to include attachment provenance:
  - Add a section that lists attachment `id`, `mimeType`, `name`, and `cached_relpath` if present.
- Consider adding a “no-API mode” that never calls Drive, only uses the cache/index (fail fast with helpful message if a referenced ID is missing from the index).

Nix flake changes
Your `flake.nix` already includes google API packages. Add `sqlite` and `pysqlite3` if you go with SQLite, and optionally `orjson` for speed.

buildInputs additions:
- `pkgs.python3Packages.orjson`
- `pkgs.python3Packages.pysqlite3` (if your Python doesn’t ship sqlite3; most do)
- Or skip sqlite and use a `drive_index.jsonl` on disk.

If you prefer a pure-JSON index (simpler to inspect)
- A single `drive_index.jsonl` with one file per line:
  {"id":"...", "name":"...", "mimeType":"...", "size":..., "md5":"...", "parentId":"...", "parentPath":"/Google AI Studio/...","localPath":"/path/to/cache/..."}
- Lookups can be done by loading one dict in memory (it might be large, but your folder size seems manageable).

Migration path for you
1) Fix auth in your existing converter (`run_local_server`).
2) Implement `drive_indexer.py` and run it once against the parent folder:
   - It will auth once, index all files, and download all attachment files that appear in your chat logs, placed in `cache_root`.
3) Modify your converter to prefer indexed/cached paths for attachments.
4) Add `bulk_convert.py` to orchestrate auto-discovery + conversion end-to-end.
5) Run the whole pipeline. On subsequent runs, it only processes new/changed logs and downloads only new attachments.

CLI example
- Build index and cache:
  ./drive_indexer.py --parent-id <FOLDER_ID> --cache-root ./gdrive_cache --credentials ./credentials.json
- Bulk convert:
  ./bulk_convert.py \
    --drive-index ./drive_index.jsonl \
    --cache-root ./gdrive_cache \
    --output-dir ./md_out \
    --mode local \
    --local-root "/mnt/gdrive/Google AI Studio" \
    --workers 4

Or, if you prefer pure-API discovery for logs too:
  ./bulk_convert.py \
    --drive-index ./drive_index.jsonl \
    --cache-root ./gdrive_cache \
    --output-dir ./md_out \
    --mode api \
    --drive-parent-id <FOLDER_ID> \
    --credentials ./credentials.json

This yields elegant, reproducible, fully-automatic processing without manual inputs, and ensures attachments are correctly matched via Drive IDs.

If you want, I can draft the minimal `drive_indexer.py` and a small diff to your `convert_gemini_chatlog.py` showing:
- The `run_local_server` fix.
- A new `resolve_attachment_path_by_id(id)` helper that checks the index JSONL/SQLite and returns a relative path for embedding.
